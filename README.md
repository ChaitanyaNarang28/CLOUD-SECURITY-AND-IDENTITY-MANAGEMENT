# 🌐CLOUD-SECURITY-AND-IDENTITY-MANAGEMENT

## 🔒 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **Cloud Security and Identity Management** using **AWS**. It demonstrates how to securely manage access to cloud resources, protect sensitive data, and implement best practices for identity management.  

A detailed **video walkthrough** is included in this repository to depict the practical implementation of:  
- **IAM Policies**  
- **User Groups**  
- **User Roles and Permissions**  

---

## 🛠️ **Key Features**  
### **1. Identity Management**  
- Created and managed **IAM roles**, **users**, and **groups** to organize access control effectively.  
- Implemented **role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure a secure and structured permissions hierarchy.  

### **2. Security Policies**  
- Designed and applied **IAM Policies** to enforce the principle of **least privilege**.  
- Configured **S3 Bucket Policies** to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive data.  
- Set up **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** for encrypting and securing data.  

### **3. Advanced Access Control**  
- Enabled **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for an additional layer of security.  
- Audited and monitored access logs using **AWS CloudTrail** for transparency and compliance.  

### **4. Scalability and Efficiency**  
- Built a scalable and secure infrastructure, ensuring seamless cloud operations.  
- Optimized **IAM policies** to support growth while maintaining tight security controls.
